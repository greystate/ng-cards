# Angular Cards

A port of my (unreleased) **xcards** project, which is a Scrum-like way of keeping track of
features and tasks in a given project.

On-going project as I wade through [Sean Fioritto][SF]'s [Angular Course][NGC] ...

## Building the project

You may notice it's all [CoffeeScript][CS], [LESS][LESS] & [Kit][KIT] - which are all supported by the excellent [CodeKit 2][CK] app. If you're more of a *Grunt* type of guy/girl, you should be able to do that as well. Just have your pre-processor(s) build into the `public` folder like this:

```python
public/
   css/
   scripts/
```
